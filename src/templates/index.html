      <h1 class="title">When You Need Pyramid</h1>
      <p>Megaframeworks make decisions for you. But if you don't fit their viewpoint, you end up fighting their decisions. Microframeworks force no decisions, making it easy to start. But as your application grows, you're on your own.</p>
      <p>In both cases, the focus is on the start: either too much or too little. Either way, finishing and staying finished is hard. You need a finishing-focused framework with an architectural design that scales down to getting started, then up as your application grows.</p>
      <p>Pyramid was made for just this. It's a Goldilocks Solution: not too small, not too big, just right. Pyramid: The Start Small, Finish Big, Stay Finished Framework.</p>

          <h1 class="title">Start Small</h1>
          <p>Getting started quickly and simply is a key attraction of lightweight frameworks. Equally, you get to choose what approaches to use for templating, database, security, and more, or use a convenient starting point with a scaffold. Pyramid excels at scaling down to the first hour of learning, while avoiding the pitfalls of framework magic.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start as a single-file module with little first-hour complexity</li>
            <li>Use a convenient scaffold to generate a sample project with your combination of subsystems</li>
            <li>Choose from a variety of templating, database, security solutions and more using the quality and convenience of Pyramid's add-on system</li>
            <li>Tap into a variety of high-quality evaluator and advanced developer documentation</li>
            <li>Ask the growing Pyramid community for tips and successes</li>

          <h1 class="title">Finish Big</h1>
          <p>Ambitious projects aspire to grow big without losing their dignity. Pyramid is uniquely equipped to scale with you. Its configuration, extension, and add-on system gives the skeleton to support your ambitions, and its architecture ensures that you don't lose those performance and quality features you started with.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Include <em>and</em> configure Pyramid add-onsinside your application</li>
            <li>Override and customize core code and add-ons from the outside, without forking</li>
            <li>Build and deliver re-usable subsystems inside and outside our organization</li>
            <li>Less magic by forgoing globals and importside-effects</li>
            <li>Use the configuration system to keep your wiring separate from your code</li>
            <li>Numerous extension facilities built into the framework</li>
            <li>Use Pyramid as a "framework framework" to craft your own special-purpose, domain-specific web system</li>
            <li>Gain insight from our longstanding culture of systems that organically get big</li>

          <p>Full-stack frameworks provide built-in value by telling you what to do. But doing something different, or using something better, leads to the dreaded "fighting the framework". Pyramid starts from a very small base, providing many high-quality choices.</p>

            <li>Don't waste time fighting the framework's decisions.</li>
            <li>"Only pay for what you eat" means less magic to live with in production</li>
            <li>No bundled templating system but instead, three very high-quality add-ons</li>
